# To Do

## Problems

- [x] Solve problem with importing `bootstrap-icons` into `.scss` files.
      The actual problem was with `sass` that doesn't rewrite URLs by default
      and there's no way to turn this option on. So, I decided to refuse
      from SCSS and use plain CSS with root variables

## Tasks

- [ ] Add icons to header
- [ ] Fix form input border and hover colors
- [ ] Fix buttons hover color
